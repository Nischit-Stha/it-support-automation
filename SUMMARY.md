## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about this project"
"I built an IT Support Automation Toolkit in Python that automates routine system health checks. It monitors disk space, CPU/RAM usage, logged-in users, and network connectivity, then generates detailed reports in multiple formats. This reduces what would take 15 minutes manually to just 30 seconds, with comprehensive documentation for compliance."

### "What challenges did you face?"
"Cross-platform compatibility was interesting - password expiry checking works differently on Linux vs other systems, so I implemented graceful degradation. I also ensured the tool handles permission errors properly since some checks require elevated privileges."

### "Why did you build it this way?"
"I used object-oriented design to make it maintainable and extensible. The modular structure means adding new checks is straightforward - you just add a method and update the CLI. I also included multiple export formats because different teams need different formats - CSV for spreadsheets, JSON for APIs, TXT for quick reading."

### "How would you extend it?"
"I'd add historical tracking to spot trends, email notifications for critical thresholds, and integration with monitoring platforms like Nagios or Prometheus. For enterprise use, I'd add database logging and a web dashboard."
